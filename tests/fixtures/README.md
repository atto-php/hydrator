# Test Fixtures

Each Fixture tests  _one_ use-case.

Each Fixture has a `$basic` property which:
- Shows the most _basic_ example of the use-case
- Will demonstrate intended usage 

Each Fixture may have other properties which:
- Are named in a way that describes the difference from the _basic_ use-case
- May demonstrate intended usage
